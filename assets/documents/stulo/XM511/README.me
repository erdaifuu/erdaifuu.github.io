basically
- master.tex is what I compiled to set everything up together, this is the file you want to compile
- wk-0x.tex is the tex for the weekly notes, use that for the actual juicy latex stuff
- premable is where I added my packages and stuff, evan.sty carried my ass, making my own sty file currently but still heavily recommend learning to use evan.sty (check evan out here "https://web.evanchen.cc/"). It's super helpful, in gaming terms its got both a high skill ceiling and a low skill floor lmao
